Collection it means group of objects.To process the data from collection we use stream concept.For that stream provide a few methods and different mechanism.
Stream comes java.util package in Java 8.

2 mechanism mostly used to work on data filter() and map().
filter() - will filter the collection based on some conditions then stores in other collection for further purpose.
map() - get each element from collection apply some operations on elements and store in other collection.
map() - get element -> apply some operations -> store in other collection.
in filter(0 data may be reduce but in map() not.
We dont process with data of collection directly.
So we add them into stream.Then apply all methods of stream.But source will not be changed after applying stream method.
sorted() - after filter() u can sort the data or count() how many elment
collect() - after filtering data collect the data and store in other collection
count() - find how meny element u got after filter
distinct() - get unique
forEach() - read element
min() and max()
this methods internally uses lambda expressions.
filter() - works with Predicate functional interface
forEach() - works with Consumer functional interface

----------------------------NONTERMINAL METHODS-----------------------------
NONTERMINAL METHODS - filter(),map(),flatMap(),distinct(),limit()-they always return stream objects so we can apply terminal methods
map() - read each element apply action and store in other collection.transform objects.Works with Function functional interface.map always return single object
flatMap() - if you want to process complex collection (which contains multiple collections) we go with flatmap().flatmap return stream of collections
distinct() -
